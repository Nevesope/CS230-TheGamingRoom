Software Design Document 
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

ANSWERS:
The Gaming Room needed a web based application and our help in picking out the proper platform for the company. The client wanted to move away from just Android and branch out to players on IOS. They also only wanted one game going at a time and for players to not have the same names. I think personally my area of best focus was, comparing and contrasting the different platforms and there different values. In my opinion, the design document made my life much easier in being able to figure out where to even start. The organization helps break down the tasks for better understanding. I honestly don't think I would really revise anything on the document. I feel like it's very thorough, without taking up to much time. When designing something for a client, you should only focus on there needs and not just your opinion. I tried to meet all of there design needs and make sure it was exactly what they wanted. A lot of technique I used going into this project was really just focusing on just following Best Practices in the coding environment.
